Time has come to listen to the crying of their puppet souls

きみがそんなにもっと楽をして行き詰まった未来と合図
Words are strong, heart is dropped, scatters ′round and falls
偽りの contact-everything 誘いこんだ傷が混ざる
誰も忘れた悲しみが fall out

偽名はただ凍る希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう分かってる答えなど捨ててしまえ

Yeah, get started, breaking the row
See how it's crazy out, it′s beyond the full realization
Yeah, get started, re-creating the world
Take my hands 'til the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout-out my soul

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
′Cause you know how to shout-out your soul

I′ve got a feeling, you must let me go
I wanna keep my faith forever
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls

I'm gonna fight them all to let you go
I wanna seek my way to answer
Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls

You know what? We look up to the sky, count on it
And halos in the clouds light me up, then I
Awake in the heat, get fired up, you call my name

Yeah, get started, breaking the row
See how it′s crazy out, it's beyond the full realization
Yeah, get started, re-creating the world
Take my hands ′til the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
'Cause I know how to shout-out my soul

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
′Cause you know how to shout-out your soul

偽名はただ凍る希望のジレンマ
息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
そう分かってる答えなど捨ててしまえ

Oh yeah, get started, breaking the row
See how it's crazy out, it's beyond the full realization
Yeah, get started, re-creating the world
Take my hands ′til the end, feel this raw emotion

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
′Cause I know how to shout-out my soul

Bring it on down, rock, rock, rock
Shake it up-up, top, top, top
'Cause you know how to shout-out your soul

Time has come to listen to the crying of their puppet souls
